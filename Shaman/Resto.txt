# Acronyms
# DFT = DPS First Tier
# DST = DPS Second Tier
#
# Why is my DFT bar filled with the same icon until the last button?
# -- Short answer, it isn't always like this.  Sometimes it's empty except for AOE or Full Party Heal (questing)
# -- On my DPS/tank, DFT contains short CD offensives and resource spending abilities
# -- When I start spamming DFT I want to make sure the healer is in full heal mode 
# ---- Spamming DFT usually means alternating between DFT and DST, not only pressing DFT.
# -- When I have the bar setup as in the image, it is so if a focus heal ability comes off 
# -- CD before I get to the end of the bar, I don't want to miss that GCD while my hardware macro 
# -- loops through a bunch of empty buttons.
